# Commando
## HTML5 turn based strategy

The game is played using hot seat multiplayer (i.e. players have to take turns playing on the same computer). To play download the entire repository as zip. Then unzip and open sample.html.

Each player can use gold to buy additional troops. Each troop starts a turn with 3 move points. Gold piles are randomly generated at the begining of the game. If a troop reaches a gold pile - his side will control it and will recieve additional gold each turn. The other side can retake the gold.
Opposing troops can attack each other and also attack the opposing base. There are two modes of attack - melee and ranged. Using an attack will use up all your move points.

A side wins when they destroy the opposing base.
